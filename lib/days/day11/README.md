# Day 11

## Code notes

I manually parsed the input data today - much easier than trying to do that programatically.

Initial thought for part2 to was to go `bigint`, but that was still waaay too slow. However moduloing by the product of all the indiviual modulos kept it all manageable.

## Coffee notes

To follow, but but first impressions are favourable.
