# Day 1

## Code notes

As straightforward as expected for day 1, with the exception that this might be a little early for a trip hazard in the input. (one of the elves had fewer digits in their total, so using a sort for part 2 needed light care.)

## Coffee notes

Advent of coffee started off with El Tolu from Colombia.

| El Tolu | Manuel Duarte Orduz | Colombia | Castillo | Washed  | Light | Orange  | Silky     | Lavender & Honey | 5          |


* Light and smooth. Perhaps a little too light, but tasted nice.
