# Day 20

## Code notes

Made another right meal of this one. Started off thinking I needed a complex data structure to manage memory/performance, especially since I assumed part 2 was going to be "now run this a gazillion times". Also took ages to make the connection between the final index and the *gap* index.

Wrote a complex solution that just didn't work. Realised my gap mistake, decided to try plain ol' arrays for performance, and voil√°!
