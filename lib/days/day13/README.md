# Day 13

## Code notes

I couldn't decide between tokenisation and recursion at first. Started with tokenisation, got it successfully tokenising, but then couldn't quite see how to interpret the tokens, especially when comparing array lengths.

So I switched to recursive comparison with ternary logic to handle the "move on" scenario.

Finally tweaked the ternary logic to mirror the `1|0|-1` structure required by `sort`to simplify part 2.

I thought the sort for part 2 might run like a dog, but it was single digit ms.
